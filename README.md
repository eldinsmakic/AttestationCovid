# AttestationCovid

Help creating certificate when you need to go out during lockdown in France,
certificate is needed to prove what was your raison to go out

The idea was simple, the official online generating certificate had not the possibility to create multiple profils ( add all your infos name, birthday) and can only generate one pdf for one profil. This app add the possibility to create multiple profils and select them to generate certificate (in PDF) in a easy way. when all the profils are created, you have just to select the raison and the profils and you will get all the certificate.
